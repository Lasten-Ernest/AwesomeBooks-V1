# Awesome-books Website

This website displays a list of books a users have added. It allows you to add and remove books from that list also. The goal of this project is to build a simple multipage page responsive book website.

In this project, I setup Html-CSS-JavaScript files for adding, removing and listing books and, added linters following the guidelines stated in the Html-CSS-JavaScript linter config documentation of Microverse.

The project contains the List, Add and Contact page.
